Majmua's frontend is made using the Yii2 framework.
Go through the Yii guide - https://www.yiiframework.com/doc/guide/2.0/en/intro-yii - to get started.
This guide - https://www.yiiframework.com/doc/guide/2.0/en/start-installation - is helpful for installation of required software.

The database used is MySQL, although MariaDB should work fine.
Manticore search -https://manticoresearch.com - is being used for indexing and searching through the database.
Sphinx search 3 - http://sphinxsearch.com - was being used, and can still be interchangably used without any change in the code.

The crawler used is a PHP script.
The crawler needs to be changed to a Scrapy based one.
